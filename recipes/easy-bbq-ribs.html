    <p>If you are looking for an easy recipe to make delicious ribs without a smoker, look no further. This is perfect for almost any occassion and is sure to give you fall off the bone tender right from the oven. All you need to do is follow the ingredients and steps below.</p> 
    <p>Now lets jump right in and make some amazing meat.</p>
    <h2>4 Main Types of Ribs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><Strong>Baby Back Ribs <em>(aka Back Ribs)</em>: </Strong>are from the upper rib cage connected to the back bone. This cut contains 11-13 ribs and has a natural curve to it. You will typically find baby back ribs in 2-3lb portions which feeds 2-3 people.</li>
        <li><strong>Spare Ribs <em>(aka Side Ribs)</em>: </strong>are the portion of ribs further down the belly towards the breastbone. This cut of ribs contains larger bones and more meat between the bones, vs baby back ribs where the majortiy of the meat is on top of the bones. This cut of ribs can come with extra cartilage and bones which aren't very appetizing to bite down on. Spare ribs take longer to cook than back ribs.</li>
        <li><strong>St. Louis Ribs: </strong>are spare ribs with the cartilage and extra bones sliced off.</li>
        <li><strong>Country Style Ribs: </strong>aren't actually ribs. They are cut from pork shoulder and are very meaty.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Choose Good Baby Back Ribs</h2>
    <p>Whether you are baking, grilling or smoking them, here are two main considerations when choosing a rack of ribs at the store.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Meat on Top: </strong>Look for baby back ribs with a good amount of meat on <em>top</em> of the ribs because baby back ribs don't have a ton of meat <em>between</em> each rib bone.</li>
        <li><strong>Fat: </strong>Look for a rack of ribs with a good amount of fat. Pork fat adds extra flavor. You can trim larger pieces off, but fat gives ribs their mouthwatering flavor and texture.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In general, a 2-1/2 to 3lb rack of baby back ribs will feed 2-3 people so I bake two racks of ribs to feed a family of 5.</p>
    <h2>How to Bake Ribs in the Oven</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Trim the Ribs:</strong></li>
        <p><Strong>Start with a 2-12 to 3lb rack of baby back ribs. </Strong>Again, look for ribs with a lot of meat on top of the bones and a good amount of fat. If there are larger pieces of fat feel free to trim them away. With a paper towel gently blot them to dry them off completely.</p>
        <li><strong>Peel away the silver skin.</strong></li>
        <p>On the back of the ribs is a connective tissue layer called the silver skin. The tissue is hard to bite through and needs to be removed before cooking the ribs no matter the method. Sometimes it's already been removed by the processor but sometimes it hasn't.</p>
        <p>Silver skin has a purply-white color and is not hard to remove. If present, stick a pairing knife underneath the skin between two rib bones near one end of the rib rack. Then get a good grip, you can use a paper towel if needed, and peel back the skin down the length of the ribs.</p>
        <li><strong>Season the ribs.</strong></li>
        <p>Next stir together a homemade seasoning mix of <strong>salt</strong>, <strong>pepper</strong>, <strong>garlic powder</strong>, <strong>cumin</strong>, <strong>smoked paprika</strong> and a little <strong>cayenne pepper</strong></p>
        <p>Sprinkle the mixture on both sides of the ribs then rub in with your fingers, coating the entire rack. Wrap the ribs in plastic wrap then refrigerate for 2 hours or up to 24 hours. You can place the ribs on the baking sheet that you will use to bake them on.</p>
        <li><strong>Cover then bake.</strong></li>
        <p>When its time to bake, unwrap the ribs then place them on a foil lined, nonstick-sprayed baking sheet. If baking more than one rack, give them both their own baking sheet.</p>
        <p>Cover the baking sheet tightly with foil then bake for 3-1/2 hours at 250 degrees. If you rack of ribs is larger than 3lbs add an additional 30 minutes baking time per 1/2 to 1lb of ribs.</p>
        <p>Carefully remove the foil on top and then drain the excess liquid.</p>
        <li><strong>Slather the Ribs in BBQ sauce</strong></li>
        <p>Slather the tops of the ribs with your favorite BBQ sauce and then bake for an additional 30 minutes to get a caramelized, lacquered top.</p>
        <li><strong>Rest, Slice, then Serve.</strong></li>
        <p>Let the ribs rest for 15 minutes or so before slicing and serving.</p>
    </ol>
