    <h2>Pro Tips for cooking salmon.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Check your salmon before cooking.</strong></li>
        <p>The average pack of portioned supermarket salmon typically doesn't have any remaining pin bones, but it is definitely best to double check. All you need to do is gently run your fingers along the surface of the fish until you feel a slight prick. Using a pair of kitchen tweezers, firmly grip the bone and pull in the direction that it is pointing.</p>
        <li><strong>Get your pan hot.</strong></li>
        <p>It is important to get your pan seriously hot as well as generously coated with oil. Once the fish hits the oil you should hear a sizzle. If not turn your heat up so the salmon can start to sizzle. <em>If you would like to avoid a potential burn gently place your salmon away from yourself, this should prevent oil from splattering towards you.</em></p>
        <li><strong>Let your salmon be.</strong></li>
        <p>Letting the salmon sit in the hot oil undisturbed for a few minutes is how you end up with a delicious crust on the salmon. After about 3 minutes, use a spatula and lift one corner, if it comes off easy you are ready to go. Flip it to the skin side and cook the skin for a few minutes as well. This will allow the fish to cook through as well.</p>
    </ul>
